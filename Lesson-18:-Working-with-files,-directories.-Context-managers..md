1. Working with text files. 
## Introduction 
Python is a very convenient tool to handle files.
File handling is nothing but a combination of various operations performed on the files such as opening the file, reading the file, and writing the file, etc.
There are generally two types of files: text file and binary file.

A `text file` stores the textual information, for example, any message saying ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù and saved as `.txt` extension, while images are stored in the form of `binary` numbers such as 0‚Äôs or 1‚Äôs and saved as `.bin` extension.

## File Operations
The main operations you will be performing on files are:
* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete

In programming jargon - **CRUD** operations.
However, do note that there are many other operations that can be performed with the files as well. Such as, copying a file or changing the properties of the file and filter.
All of these operations are important to manipulate the file. This manipulation ensures that the file operations can be performed as per the exact requirement of the user working on the file.
