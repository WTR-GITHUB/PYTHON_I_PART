### What is a function?
Functions are **a convenient way to divide your code into useful blocks, allowing us to order our code, make it more readable, reuse it and save some time**. Also functions are a key way to define interfaces so programmers can share their code.
In Python, you define a function with the _**def**_ keyword, then write the function identifier (name) followed by parentheses and a colon.
The next thing you have to do is make sure you indent with a tab or 4 spaces, and then specify what you want the function to do for you.

```
def function_name():
    # What to make the function do
```
A simple example - functions that prints 'Hello world':

```
def print_smth():
    print('Hello world!')
```

Or prints random int number from 0 to 10:

```
def get_random_number():
    print(random.randit(0, 10))
```
