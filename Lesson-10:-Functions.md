### What is a function?
Functions are a convenient way to divide your code into useful blocks, allowing us to order our code, make it more readable, reuse it and save some time. Also functions are a key way to define interfaces so programmers can share their code.
In Python, you define a function with the def keyword, then write the function identifier (name) followed by parentheses and a colon.
The next thing you have to do is make sure you indent with a tab or 4 spaces, and then specify what you want the function to do for you.

```
def function_name():
    # What to make the function do
```
