## Logging library

Logging is a very useful tool in a programmer‚Äôs toolbox. It can help you develop a better understanding of the flow of a program and discover scenarios that you might not even have thought of while developing.

By logging useful data from the right places, you can not only debug errors easily but also use the data to analyze the performance of the application to plan for scaling or look at usage patterns to plan for marketing.

The [logging module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) in Python is a ready-to-use and powerful module that is designed to meet the needs of beginners as well as enterprise teams. It is used by most of the third-party Python libraries, so you can integrate your log messages with the ones from those libraries to produce a homogeneous log for your application.

### Import the library:
`import logging`

### Logging vs Print Statement
`Logging` and `Print` both can be used to debug the code but still, there are reasons for you to choose `log` over `print()`.

A `Log file` contains a log message with other information such as line number, module name, date, time, etc. On the other hand, a `print` statement only has a log message.

A `Log file` will save the records of the application even after it is closed but a print statement will lose out all the records and log message just after the execution stops.

The only time when you should consider using a `print()` statement over a `log` is when you need to display a help statement on the command line.

### Logging
There are five ways we can display a log message in python with setting log levels: **DEBUG**, **INFO**, **WARNING**, **ERROR**, and **CRITICAL**.

```python
import logging

logging.debug('This is a debug message')
logging.info('This is an info message')
logging.warning('This is a warning message')
logging.error('This is an error message')
logging.critical('This is a critical message')

-------------------OUTPUT---------------------
WARNING:root:This is a warning message
ERROR:root:This is an error message
CRITICAL:root:This is a critical message
```
## Exercises: 
üß† : Repeat the [Conditional Statements](https://github.com/CodeAcademy-Online/python-new-material/wiki/Lesson-6:-Conditional-Statements), [Loops](https://github.com/CodeAcademy-Online/python-new-material/wiki/Lesson-8:-Loops), [Functions](https://github.com/CodeAcademy-Online/python-new-material/wiki/Lesson-10:-Functions) to finish these task.
* Create a `Calculator` class with main functionality: add, divide, multiply, subtract , etc.. Initiate class and show up some calculations.
