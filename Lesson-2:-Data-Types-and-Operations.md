1. Integers, Floats
1. Strings, Boolean Type

# Integers

Z = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}

How to instantiate a variable as an integer in Python

```python
a = 5
print(a)

b = 25
print(b)
```

# Integer Operations
Possible operations:
| Operation| Result |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| x + y  | sum of x and y  |
| x - y  | difference of x and y  |
| x * y  | product of x and y  |
| x / y  | quotient of x and y  |
| x // y  | floored quotient of x and y  |
| x % y  | remainder of x / y  |
| x ** y | x to the power y |

```python
a = 5
b = 25

c = a + b 
print(c) # prints 20

c = a - b
print(c)

c = a * b
print(c)

c = b / a
print(a)

c = b // a
print(a)


c = a % b
print(c)

c = a ** b
print(c)
```


# Float type

Z = {..., -2.5 , ..., -2.0, ... , -1.0, ... , 0, ... , 1.0, ... , 2.0, ... , 2.5, ...}

### Note that there can be endless number possibilities between two floats.

# Integer Operations
Same operations/ mathematical expressions apply to the float numbers

Possible operations:
| Operation| Result |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| x + y  | sum of x and y  |
| x - y  | difference of x and y  |
| x * y  | product of x and y  |
| x / y  | quotient of x and y  |
| x // y  | floored quotient of x and y  |
| x % y  | remainder of x / y  |
| x ** y | x to the power y |

```python
a = 5
b = 25

c = a + b 
print(c) # prints 20

c = a - b
print(c)

c = a * b
print(c)

c = b / a
print(a)

c = b // a
print(a)


c = a % b
print(c)

c = a ** b
print(c)
```
