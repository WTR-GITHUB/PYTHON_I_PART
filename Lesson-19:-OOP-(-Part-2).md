## Introduction 
As we already know, Python is an Object-Oriented Programming language. Everything in Python is an object. Like other Object-Oriented languages, when creating objects using classes, there are 4 basic principles for writing clean and concise code. These principles are called the **four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP)**. These four pillars are:  **Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Abstraction.** 

### Why OOP?
A few to name:
* It makes it so much easier to maintain and update existing code.
* Provides code reusability.
* Provides a modular structure.
* It is easy to debug.

**As per normal functions, you can assign default arguments to self parameters and instant method arguments**

## Exercises: 
üß† : Repeat the [Conditional Statements](https://github.com/CodeAcademy-Online/python-new-material/wiki/Lesson-6:-Conditional-Statements), [Loops](https://github.com/CodeAcademy-Online/python-new-material/wiki/Lesson-8:-Loops), [Functions](https://github.com/CodeAcademy-Online/python-new-material/wiki/Lesson-10:-Functions) to finish these task.
* Create a `Calculator` class with main functionality: add, divide, multiply, subtract , etc.. Initiate class and show up some calculations.
