## merge conflicts, how to solve them
### Hands on part
Follow the steps in order to get the merge conflict

1. split into pairs of 2people
1. create an empty repo
1. invite each other to collaborate
1. create a python file, write couple of functions and commit changes and push.
1. let another party to pull latest changes
1. At this point it is important that both of you do a change to the same file, same function. Try reimplementing it in some other way. But important thing here is that both parties should be trying to do changes in the same place of the file.
1. One party does classic -> add, commit , push. Then another tries doing so as well... And get's a merge conflict
1. communicate with your party which version is the right one and should stay in source code.
1. solve conflict.
1. push changes.
