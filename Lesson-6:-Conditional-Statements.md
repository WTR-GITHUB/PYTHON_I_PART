Mighty ‘if’

# Python Conditions and If statements

When executing code we usually want to make some sort of decisions according to the data we are getting, if statements allows us to that eactly.

How it looks like:
```python
if <test_expression>:
    statement(s)
```

For checking of the conditions, python support usual mathematical expressions:

* Equals: a == b
* Not Equals: a != b
* Less than: a < b
* Less than or equal to: a <= b
* Greater than: a > b
* Greater than or equal to: a >= b
