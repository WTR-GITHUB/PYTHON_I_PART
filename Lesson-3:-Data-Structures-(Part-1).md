# Lists

In this section we will cover another Python Data Structure - List or what in other programming languages is called an array.

Lists can contain no values whatsoever, be empty, or as many objects as RAM allows us to hold. What is more, it so happens that in Python lists can hold any types of values,  it could be other objects, functions, strings, integers, your own data types or even other lists.

## Creating an empty list in python:
```python
my_list = [] # Instantiating empty list
```
## Adding values to the list 
There is method called .append() that allows to insert an item into the list: append(<object>)

```python
my_list = []

name = "Tom"
my_list.append(name)
print(my_list)
```

# Tuple
