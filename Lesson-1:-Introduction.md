# What is Python? üêç 

Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn‚Äôt specialized for any specific problems.

Python is a dynamically typed language. What is dynamic? We don't have to declare the type of variable while assigning a value to a variable in Python. Other languages like C, C++, Java, etc.., there is a strict declaration of variables before assigning values to them.

Python don't have any problem even if we don't declare the type of variable. It states the kind of variable in the runtime of the program. So, Python is a dynamically typed language. Let's see one example.
