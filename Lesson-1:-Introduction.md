# What is Python? üêç 

Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn‚Äôt specialized for any specific problems.

Python is a dynamically typed language. What is dynamic? We don't have to declare the type of variable while assigning a value to a variable in Python. Other languages like C, C++, Java, etc.., there is a strict declaration of variables before assigning values to them.

Python don't have any problem even if we don't declare the type of variable. It states the kind of variable in the runtime of the program. So, Python is a dynamically typed language. Let's see one example.


## ‚¨áÔ∏è Download Python

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Download VSCode

https://code.visualstudio.com/download

In this course teachers will be using VScode, you can use whatever tooling you like, it is up to developer to decide what tools to use especially for IDE. However for beginners we strictly recommend to use the same setup.

Things to do:
* setup python with VSCode
* setup linter


# üíª First program

Traditionally first program every programmer writes is printing out "Hello, World" in the terminal. Let's do the same thing.

code:
```python
print("Hello, World")
```

Congratulations you now speak Python! But we are not stopping here now are we? (Hope not...)

## Python operators

Python has a lot of tools that are already in place for you to use. Today we will review Operators.
Operators are simply actions similar to actions in you everyday calculator.

| Operator  | Name | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| +  | Addition  | x + y  |
| -  | Subtraction  | x - y  |
| *  | Multiplication  | x * y  |
| /  | Division  | x / y  |
| %  | Modulus  | x % y  |
| ** | Exponentiation | x ** y  |
| // | Floor Division| x // y  |

Let's try them out:

```python
10 + 10
```

```python
10 - 5
```

```python
10 % 3
```


```python
5 ** 3
```


```python
5 ** 3
```
Are the results understandable? If not raise discussion in class.

## Excercise:
üß† 
* Try the operations yourself.
* Make sure you have the IDE setup.
* Try chaining operations
