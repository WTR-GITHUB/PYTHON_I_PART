Print, type, len, ..etc.

# Built-in functions

## print()

As we have seen before we used `print` couple of times already and made ourselves familiar with it. We did not create the function itself as it comes out of the box right after installing python. It is important to mention that this function is not as dull as it may seem from the first glance, in fact it's quite versatile.

print(object(s), sep=separator, end=end, file=file, flush=flush)
